# GitHub Integration

GitHub Copilot CLI has deep integration with GitHub, allowing you to work with repositories, issues, pull requests, and more directly from your terminal.

## Prerequisites

To use GitHub features, you need:

1. **GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated**
   - Install: `brew install gh` (macOS) or see [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com/)
   - Authenticate: `gh auth login`
   - Verify: `gh auth status`
   - **This is required for GitHub integration to work**

2. **Authenticated GitHub account** - via `/login` or PAT

3. **Git repository** - Working directory must be a git repo

4. **Remote configured** - Usually `origin` pointing to GitHub

5. **Copilot subscription** - Active subscription with your GitHub account

## Working with Git Repositories

### Repository Detection

When you launch Copilot CLI in a Git repository, it automatically:

- Detects the repository
- Reads Git status
- Identifies remote URLs
- Tracks current branch

```
> What GitHub repository am I in?

AI: You're in the repository: username/my-project
    Remote: https://github.com/username/my-project.git
    Current branch: main
    Status: 3 modified files, 1 untracked file
```

### Git Operations

```
> Show me git status

> What changed since last commit?

> Show me the diff of staged files

> What's the commit history for the last 10 commits?
```

### Branch Management

```
> Create a new branch called feature-login

> Switch to the develop branch

> What branch am I on?

> List all branches
```

### Commits

```
> Show me the last commit

> What changed in commit abc123?

> Show me commits by author John

> Find commits that modified @src/auth.js
```

## Pull Requests

### Viewing Pull Requests

```
> Show me open pull requests for this repo

> What's in PR #42?

> Show me pull requests assigned to me

> List PRs with label "bug"
```

### PR Details

```
> Show details of PR #123

AI: Pull Request #123: "Add user authentication"
    Author: @username
    Status: Open
    Checks: ✅ All passing
    Reviews: 2 approved
    Files changed: 5
    +234 -67 lines
```

### PR Diffs

```
> Show me the diff of PR #42

> What files changed in PR #123?

> Review the changes in PR #56
```

### PR Comments

```
> Show comments on PR #42

> What did reviewers say about PR #123?
```

## The `/pr` Command

The `/pr` command is a dedicated shortcut for operating on the **pull request associated with your current branch**. Rather than writing natural language prompts or dropping into `gh pr` commands, `/pr` gives you a fast, focused interface for common PR actions without leaving the CLI.

### What `/pr` Does

```
> /pr
```

When run without arguments, `/pr` detects the PR open for your current branch and presents a summary, or offers to create one if none exists.

### Checking PR Status

```
> /pr

PR #147: "Add password reset flow"
Branch:  feature/password-reset → main
Status:  Open
Checks:  ✅ CI passing (4/4)
Reviews: 1 approved, 1 requesting changes
```

### Viewing the PR Diff

```
> /pr diff

Changes in PR #147:
  src/auth/password-reset.js      +89  -0
  src/routes/auth.js              +22  -3
  tests/auth/password-reset.test  +54  -0
```

### Checking CI / Review Status

```
> /pr checks

Check runs for PR #147:
  ✅ build (2m 14s)
  ✅ test (1m 48s)
  ✅ lint (0m 32s)
  ✅ security-scan (3m 01s)
```

### Reviewing PR Comments

```
> /pr comments

Review comments on PR #147:
  @reviewer1 [approved]:
    "Looks good overall, nice clean implementation."

  @reviewer2 [changes requested] on src/auth/password-reset.js line 42:
    "Token expiry should be configurable, not hardcoded."
```

### Common `/pr` Patterns

```
# View PR for current branch
> /pr

# See what changed
> /pr diff

# Check CI status
> /pr checks

# Read review feedback
> /pr comments

# Ask Copilot to address a review comment
> /pr comments
[Copilot shows the comment requesting changes]
> Fix the issue raised by @reviewer2 about the hardcoded token expiry

[Copilot edits the code]
> /diff     # Confirm the fix looks right
```

### Driving a PR to Green Automatically (v1.0.66+)

```
# Fix one thing per run, pacing around CI, until checks are green
> /pr auto

# Keep looping until the PR is merged
> /pr automerge
```

`/pr auto` starts a self-paced loop: it makes one fix per run, waits appropriately for CI, and repeats until the PR's checks are green. `/pr automerge` behaves the same way but keeps going until the PR is actually merged. Both loops can be managed or stopped from [`/loop`](04-slash-commands.md) or [`/every`](04-slash-commands.md).

### `/pr` vs `/delegate` vs `/review`

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/pr` | Operate on the **existing** PR for the current branch: status, diff, checks, comments |
| `/delegate` | **Create** a new PR — implements changes, commits, pushes, and opens the PR |
| `/review` | Run the **code review agent** locally on your uncommitted changes |

> **Tip:** A natural workflow is `/delegate` to create the PR, then `/pr` to monitor it as reviewers respond.

---

## Creating Pull Requests with /delegate

The `/delegate` command creates PRs automatically:

### Basic Delegation

```
> /delegate Fix typo in README

What happens:
1. ✅ Creates new branch: copilot-fix-readme-typo
2. ✅ Makes changes to README.md
3. ✅ Commits changes
4. ✅ Pushes to remote
5. ✅ Creates pull request
6. 🔗 Returns PR URL
```

### Complex Delegations

```
> /delegate Add user authentication with JWT tokens
  - Create auth middleware
  - Add login/register endpoints
  - Add password hashing
  - Update user model
  - Add tests
```

AI will:
1. Plan all changes
2. Create feature branch
3. Implement all features
4. Commit changes
5. Push and create PR

### Delegation Best Practices

✅ **Be specific** - Clear description helps AI understand  
✅ **Scope appropriately** - Not too large for single PR  
✅ **Review before merge** - Check the PR thoroughly  
✅ **Provide context** - Mention related issues or requirements  

Example:

```
> /delegate Implement issue #45
  Add pagination to user list endpoint
  Default 20 items per page
  Accept page and limit query params
  Update API docs
```

## Creating Git Worktrees from the Pull Requests Screen (v1.0.60)

You can create a git worktree for any pull request directly from the pull requests screen — no need to run `git worktree add` manually.

**Why use it:** Review or test a PR in an isolated directory while keeping your main checkout on its current branch. Particularly useful when you want to run the PR's code without stashing your own work.

**How it works:**
1. Open the pull requests screen from the CLI
2. Select a PR and choose the **"Create worktree"** option
3. Copilot CLI runs `git worktree add` and checks out the PR branch in a new directory

> **Note:** When a PR branch name contains slashes (e.g., `feature/cli/foo`), the worktree directory uses a flat name (`feature-cli-foo`) to avoid nested directory issues.

---

## Pull Requests Tab Merge Status (v1.0.66+)

The **Pull requests** tab now shows the merge status for each listed pull request (e.g., clean, blocked, has conflicts) alongside its checks and review status. Press `r` in the tab to refresh the cached statuses on demand instead of waiting for the next automatic refresh.

---

## Auto-Linking Issue and PR References (v1.0.60)

Bare `#number` references in your prompts (e.g., `#42`) are automatically linked to the current git repository. You no longer need to use a full URL or special syntax to reference issues or PRs.

**Example:**
```
> What's the status of #42?

AI: Issue #42 "Add dark mode support" is currently open with 3 comments…
```

This works for both issues and pull requests in the remote repository Copilot CLI has detected for your current directory.

### Creating Issues

While you can't create issues directly, you can prepare the content:

```
> Draft an issue for the bug I found in @src/auth.js

AI: Here's a suggested issue:

Title: Authentication fails with expired tokens

Description:
When a user's token expires, the auth middleware
throws an unhandled exception instead of returning 401.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Log in with valid credentials
2. Wait 24 hours
3. Make API request
4. Server crashes

Expected: Return 401 Unauthorized
Actual: Server error 500

Code location: src/auth.js line 42

[Copy this to GitHub to create issue]

## GitHub-Specific Commands

### Repository Commands

```
> Clone repository username/repo-name

> Initialize a new git repository

> Add remote origin <url>

> Set upstream branch
```

### Branch Commands

```
> Create and switch to new branch

> Merge branch-name into current branch

> Rebase current branch on main

> Delete branch branch-name
```

### Commit Commands

```
> Stage all changes

> Commit with message "feat: add login"

> Amend last commit

```

## GitHub CLI Integration

Copilot CLI uses `gh` (GitHub CLI) under the hood for GitHub features. You can also use gh commands directly:

### Direct gh Commands

```
> Use gh to create an issue

> Run gh pr list

> Use gh to clone username/repo

> Run gh release create v1.0.0

> !gh repo view owner/repo

> !gh issue create --title "Bug" --body "Description"
```

### Common gh Commands with Copilot CLI

```
# View repository
> Show me repository information
[Uses: gh repo view]

# Create issue
> Create a GitHub issue for the bug I found
[Uses: gh issue create]

# List PRs
> Show open pull requests
[Uses: gh pr list --state open]

# Create PR
> /delegate Fix the authentication bug
[Uses: gh pr create]

# View PR
> Show details of PR #42
[Uses: gh pr view 42]

# Clone repository
> Clone the repository username/project
[Uses: gh repo clone username/project]
```

### Verify gh CLI is Working

```
> !gh auth status

> !gh repo view

> !gh pr list
```

If gh commands fail, authenticate:
```bash
gh auth login
```

## Best Practices

### DO:

✅ **Work in Git repo** - Most features require Git  
✅ **Use /delegate** - For automated PRs  
✅ **Reference issues** - Link PRs to issues  
✅ **Review PRs** - Check delegated changes  
✅ **Keep branches focused** - One feature per branch  

### DON'T:

❌ **Delegate huge changes** - Keep PRs reasonable  
❌ **Skip review** - Always check AI-generated PRs  
❌ **Force push** - Unless you know what you're doing  
❌ **Ignore CI failures** - Fix them before merging  

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

```
> I can't access the repository

Solutions:
1. Check gh CLI: gh auth status
2. Authenticate gh: gh auth login
3. Check Copilot: /user show
4. Try: /logout then /login
5. Verify Copilot subscription
6. Check repo permissions
```

### GitHub CLI Not Working

```
> GitHub features not working

Solutions:
1. Verify gh installed: gh --version
2. Authenticate: gh auth login
3. Check status: gh auth status
4. Test gh directly: gh repo view
5. Refresh token: gh auth refresh
```

### Remote Issues

```
> Push failed or remote not found

Solutions:
1. Verify remote: git remote -v
2. Check branch tracking
3. Ensure proper permissions
4. Try HTTPS vs SSH URL
```

### API Rate Limits

```
> Getting rate limit errors

Solutions:
1. Wait for rate limit reset
2. Use authenticated requests
3. Check: /usage
4. Reduce API calls
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Fix PR

```
> /delegate Fix typo in README line 23
  Change "recieve" to "receive"

✅ Created branch: copilot-fix-readme-typo
✅ Fixed typo in README.md
✅ Committed: "Fix typo in README"
✅ Pushed to origin
✅ Created PR #78
🔗 https://github.com/user/repo/pull/78
```

### Example 2: Feature Implementation

```
> Show me issue #45

Issue #45: Add export to CSV feature

> /delegate Implement issue #45
  Add CSV export button to data table
  Create downloadCSV function
  Include all visible columns
  Format dates properly

[AI implements everything]

✅ Created PR #79: "Add CSV export feature (fixes #45)"
```
